## Java API. Maven Jetty plugin
Back-end: A REST API service to provide data for the front-end application.

## HTML5, CSS and Javascript application
Front-end: Client application to consume data provided by the back-end.

## How it Works
The back-end service provides the front-end with data stored in a MySQL database. The data is requested as needed and sent to the client in json object format.

## Routes
The resource provides routes to Sing In, register and find cars registered in the database.

### Variables:
In **./properties/data.properties** correctly fill your SQL database connection data. You must also define the queries for SELECT and INSERT into the database.
